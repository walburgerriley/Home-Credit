Predictive Risk Classification for Loan Eligibility
üöÄ Summary of the Business Problem and Project Objective
Many individuals are denied loans due to a lack of traditional credit history. This represents a missed opportunity to serve creditworthy customers and increase revenue. Our project aims to solve this issue by developing a machine learning classification model that accurately assesses the risk level of loan applicants, even those with little or no credit history.

The main objective is to expand the eligible borrower pool while maintaining responsible lending standards, ultimately increasing profitability and promoting financial inclusion.

üß† Project Objective and Analytics Approach
Our goal is to build a supervised machine learning classification model to predict whether an individual is risky or not risky. This model will use historical loan application data, financial behavior patterns, and spending habits to make accurate predictions.

Key Success Metrics:
Improved accuracy in identifying risk levels.

Increased loan approvals for applicants with limited/no credit history.

Reduced default rates due to better risk predictions.

üí° Our Solution
The team developed and trained a supervised classification model using a dataset composed of anonymized applicant records. The workflow included:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature engineering and selection

Model training and evaluation using various algorithms

Final model selection based on accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score

Our chosen model achieved strong performance metrics and demonstrated the ability to safely extend credit to previously underserved applicants.

üë• My Contribution to the Project
As part of the data science team, my contributions included:

Leading the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and insights

Assisting in feature selection and transformation to improve model performance

Collaborating with teammates to compare multiple classification models

Writing documentation and helping with GitHub version control

Participating in group discussions around ethical AI use and fairness in lending

üí∞ Business Value of the Solution
This solution directly addresses a key business opportunity:

Revenue Growth: By expanding the pool of eligible applicants, we can increase loan originations.

Risk Mitigation: More accurate predictions reduce defaults, protecting company resources.

Market Expansion: Reaching previously underserved customers improves our brand and market share.

Inclusion: Promotes financial access and fairness by leveraging alternative data for risk assessment.

‚ö†Ô∏è Difficulties Encountered
Throughout the project, we faced several challenges:

Data Imbalance: Risky applicants were underrepresented, requiring resampling strategies.

Incomplete Data: Some key features had missing values that required imputation or exclusion.

Bias and Fairness: Ensuring the model didn‚Äôt unintentionally discriminate based on sensitive attributes was a key ethical challenge.

Model Selection: Balancing accuracy with interpretability when selecting the final model.

üìö What We Learned
This project gave us valuable insights and practical experience in:

Building robust machine learning classification pipelines

Handling imbalanced datasets and improving model generalizability

Understanding the real-world impact of ML decisions in the financial sector

Working collaboratively in a data science team using GitHub and Jupyter Notebooks
